Hello. 
I am Grimcreeper420, and I intend to find errors in the code of minecraft, and educational game websites like Blooket, quizziz, and quislet. 
If anyone wants to help me learn to read code better or accomplish the stated goals, it is welcome.
I look forward to working with the Github community, goodbye.
